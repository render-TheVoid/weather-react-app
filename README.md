# **void - Weather App**
Welcome to void, the app that tells you the weather because apparently, even basic human senses are too much effort for you.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repo (because apparently you have nothing better to do).
2. Run `npm install` (yes, it’s mandatory, genius).
3. Run `npm start` (congrats, you made it this far).
4. Type a city name and hit Enter or click the search button. Try not to mess it up.

## Live Demo / Deployment
Check out the app in action here: [void Weather App](https://voidweather.vercel.app/) 🌤️  

Go ahead, type a city, and watch it roast the weather for you in style.

## Tech Stack
- **React** ⚛️ – because plain HTML is for peasants  
- **JavaScript** – making sense of weather since forever  
- **Fetch API** – for begging OpenWeather for data  
- **OpenWeather API** 🌍 – clouds in your code, not your window  
- **CSS** – so it doesn’t look like total trash  
- **Vite** – fast enough to pretend you’re productive  

## Features
- Fetches weather data faster than you can misspell "precipitation."
- Snarky error messages for when you inevitably search for "Narnia" or leave the input blank.
- Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and "feels like" vibes, because you clearly need help understanding the weather.
- Weather icons so fancy they’ll make your eyes jealous of your screen.

## Pro Tips
- Don’t search for empty strings unless you want the app to roast you for chasing "air."
- If it fails to fetch weather, it’s probably your fault, but try again anyway.
- Requires an OpenWeatherMap API key. Get one, or live in ignorance.
